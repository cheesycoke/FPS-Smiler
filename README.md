# FPS-Smiler
A silly Godot object to display framerate in the least helpful way possible, made in 4.5.1

[Based on a debug feature from Super Mario Strikers](https://x.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/1649132614119223302)

Add the `FPSSmiler` folder to your project and then place an instance of `fps_smiler.tscn` into your HUD scene, positioned however you want.

Inherits Node2D, so it doesn't position itself dynamically.
Have fun!
